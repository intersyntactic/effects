# Changelog

## 0.1.0

- First release: the vocabulary of effects and the driver interfaces, moved
  out of `is_airlock_api` so a driver depends on effects alone.
  `PathInRepo`, `ProgramName`, `FileText`, `Args`, `ReadResult`, `Wrote`,
  `ExecResult` (`Exited`, `Killed`), `Outcome` (`Ran`, `Refused`),
  `Progress` (`Printed`), and `FileDriver`, `ProgramDriver`.
